Helianthus born as an idea to supplied a middleware for people that know a client side technology such as Javascript and SQL.
Helianthus provides a layer to get relational database results (as a table result) based on a query, you can include parameter or not.
Helianthis also integrated support for several formatter, for instance .html will render a human readable format for people, but also include json and xml.
In the future we are expecting to have java bin (byte code serialized), csv, excel and so on.
Also the Helianthus has the support to run custom workflows, by default it reads a SQL query (based on an id/path) executes the query over a specific data base and serialize in the second step the result to some format.
